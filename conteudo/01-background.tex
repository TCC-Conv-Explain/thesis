\chapter{Background}

In this chapter, we will introduce important concepts required for the understanding of this study.
We begin by introducing Explainable AI (XAI) and its principles. We also introduce Neural Networks and important concepts such as Gradient Descent and Back Propagation. 
Finally, we introduce Convolutional Neural Networks, the main focus of this study.

\section{Explainable AI}

With the rise of Machine Learning models in the last decade in the business and academic areas, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly present in important decision-making tasks. 
However, as AI models have become more sophisticated, particularly with the advent of Deep Learning techniques, their internal workings have often remained opaque. 
Explainable AI aims to make models and their decisions more transparent, interpretable and understandable to both experts and inexperienced users.
