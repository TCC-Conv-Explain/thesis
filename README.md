# Project Essay

This repo is responsible for the versioning of the final project essay.

## Initial Planning

The Project will have the following sections (initially):

- Gradient Descent
- Neural Networks (Forward and Back Propagation Overview)
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Feature Visualization (DeepDream and such)
- Pixel Attribution (Saliency Map, GradCam, ...)
- Network Dissection? [This link for more info](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/cnn-features.html#network-dissection)
- Local Model-Agnostic Explanations (only LIME by now)
- Experiments comparing different Pixel Attribution techniques
